		<description><![CDATA[Jimmy and I are glad to hear you made it through ferry ordeal.  We were stationed at Fort Gulick, Panama, for three years.  It was amazing.  Drove the highway from Colon to Panama City many times.  
Quinn, my Beldian Malinois, surely misses Diana.  
Hope the rest of your trip is safe.]]></description>

Thank you also for your much appreciated work on the translations for Rafa&#039;s memoriam]]></description>
