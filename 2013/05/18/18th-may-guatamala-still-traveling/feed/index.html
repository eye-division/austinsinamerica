		<description><![CDATA[Another excellent blog.
Well done for dealing with the dodgy cop. You&#039;ve obviously got a good eye for a scam. I&#039;d imagine your many trips have led to an instinctive feeling for what is right.
Hope the luck remains with you.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Awesome!
The tyre guy in Long Beach who prepares wheels and tyres for land speed record breakers was shocked that we were not fitting the tyres with talc. His advice is that it reduces friction between tube and tyre which helps reduce tyre problems. I share because it seemed to work for us. Thanks for the stories. LOL US]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[I was SO pleased to have met you in Condesa Restaurant in Antigua Guatemala 2 days ago.  I admire your adventursome spirit and commend you on your reportage and photos.
If you&#039;re ever back this way, please look me up.  I&#039;d love to meet up with you again, and know lots of great activities in and around Antigua.
Did you look up the www.servas.org link?
Another good trip would be coast to coast in the USA and one can tootle around the British Isles this way too!  I did it several times!
PEACE &#038; FRIENDSHIP (however fleeting!)]]></description>
