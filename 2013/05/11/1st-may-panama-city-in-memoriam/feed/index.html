		<description><![CDATA[Wise words Orly and rest assured you there with us every inch of the way. IT becomes more and more evident that we are accomplishing this journey for all that have talked to us, seen the cars, helped in small and big ways, advised, sent encouragement and wished us well. Without all of you it would have been much harder and not so much fun. Thank you each and every one of you, from the Austin Team]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jack, Amanda, dear friends: this adventure has all the possible nuances.
cultures, subcultures, ancestors, modernism, life, and...
That man will be in your memories for ever, beside other bunch of people than enriched your personal histories. I will be very happy if I am one of that persons.
A vey big hug to help overcome this sad moment.
Just think about what Rafael wanted you to do (I don´t know if the sentence is right, but you know the meaning, for sure...)
Yours.  Orly]]></description>
