		<description><![CDATA[Enjoying the updates. I&#039;m a bit worried that we haven&#039;t had one for a while - There must be a monster essay on the way. Never mind Diane&#039;s spanner-smashed finger, I&#039;m worried for Jack&#039;s typing digit. Best wishes to all the team.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Jack - I am impressed by the spares you keep finding in the depths of your storage box.   Not nearly as many plumbing widgets as I have unearthed after 34 years in the Marston Road emporium of course.  I blame most of it on DH.
Most of them sold to someone with more money than sense.
Rather wish I was with you all and keep overtaking those trucks!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Great to meet yourselves in Antofagasta the other day in the hotel carpark and thanks for your time in explaining your mission probably well over the 1000&#039;th time. We both wish yourselves the best in your journey. In our few months in Chile have come to admire them for quite some amazing mechanical ability in getting things going that in our current time would just be thrown away. I suspect that same spirit is the same with your fantastic cars. The other advantage is that you can get at the engine! I hope you avoid any more sand on your head gasket. Will continue to read your updates with interest.]]></description>
