		<description><![CDATA[What a story! And what wonderful help you have had getting the repairs done. Having the cars in the workshop at least solved the problem of finding secure storage while you go to Cusco and Machu Picchu.  A silver lining of sorts. All best wishes, Steve]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[It must have been a worrying time for all. But so lucky to have found Pablo and Javier, enabling you all to continue the trip. For your interest, the unpleasnt noise in my Ruby on the Interlaken trip was a bigend. The white metal had totaly disappeared from the end cap on No. 3 cylinder. All fixed now and ready to go again. Only help up by two feet of snow all around and the first Rally at Pitlochry this coming w/end.
Brilliant blog and lovely photos. I look forward to the next one. Cheers, Johny J]]></description>
