		<description><![CDATA[You&#039;re making better progress than we are - lagging a week (not weak!) behind, on your updates. 
It&#039;s a fantastic story, and wouldn&#039;t be the same without a few challenges. Hope you&#039;re still enjoying the adventure - Machu Picchu looks amazing, I&#039;d love to have seen an A7 parked in amongst the buildings. Maybe you can do that on the way back!!!!!!!]]></description>
