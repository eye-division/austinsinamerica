		<description><![CDATA[&quot;At first the roads were, as we had become accustomed to, rather narrow with a poor surface in places keeping you permanently alert for holes and ruts.&quot;

Very similar to the A34 then.

Lovin it - buena suerte.

		<description><![CDATA[Wonderful reading about your progress on my iPad in the comfort of my armchair! Sorry to hear about your mechanical problems, good that you have sorted the head gasket/head. In my A7 experience, logic and a calm approach will usually resolve most problems. Unfortunately, I have no experience of 4 speed Gboxs - only 3 speed so no pearls of wisdom. Everything is solvable with a Seven - keep calm you can do it!

All the very best to you all, good luck, Bryan Downes, Stafford UK.]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[Worried I was about you all, jolly good to see on the screen again.
Your ability to writte as if to put us in the back seat, as if we were there is superb.
Thank you for the time you spend doing this, you must be half dead when you paste all this info together. The four Austins is like something from a novel. &quot;See you&quot; in Perú.]]></description>
