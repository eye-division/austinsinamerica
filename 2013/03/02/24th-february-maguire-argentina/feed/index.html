		<description><![CDATA[We are most impressed with your rapid progress.I amsorry I didn&#039;t get a chance to speak more to Diana on Thursday,but the line was not perfect and the thought of you having to pay for a mobile call from Chile was more than my Scottish Ancestry could cope with.
However your spare parts are on the way to North Carolina and will hopefully arrive in time for River to collect them.
In the meantime I am so excited by your blog that I have missed an episde of The Archers for the first time in 58 years.
Keep on Truckin&#039;
