		<description><![CDATA[Fasinating reading. Once started, couldn&#039;t put it &#039;down&#039;! Read to the very last report. Just a thoght; have you tried advancing the ignition on the engines with the use of the alcholic petrol? By how much? I don&#039;t know - by small increments. It could give cooler running and less gasket and valve damage. 

Enjoy your adventure SAFELY.

All the very best]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[We are really pleased to read the story and begin to learn of your progress. 
As River suggested seems like we have all had a Bermuda triangle experience.
We think of you all often and wish you all the luck for the stay in Lima. I&#039;m sure that it will be possible to get thing mended and then its getting the miles covered!
If there is ever anything that we might do to help just ask.
We&#039;ll be watching you!
Safe travelling!]]></description>
