		<description><![CDATA[Given the choice what to read first this morning, the newspaper or your report, the latter took priority by far. Congratulations on reaching this important milestone; enjoy a few restful days at the seaside in Cartagena. It must be exhausting pushing A7s up hills at high altitude. Watching this space avidly and looking forward to the next episode. All best wishes to you all, Steve]]></description>
