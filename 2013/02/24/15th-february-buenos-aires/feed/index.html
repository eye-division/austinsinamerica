		<description><![CDATA[Sorry you&#039;ve had some very important stuff taken, what on earth do the culprits think they are going to do with it......smoke it.?

Check out the local markets and buy it back.

Worried about all the orange juice in photos.......change immediately to large beers.

Last day at MHS tomorrow ....we&#039;ll raise a glass to you. Cheers.
