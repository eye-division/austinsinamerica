		<description><![CDATA[So glad to read that your cars are all together.  Even better to know that you are all together.  We are looking forward to reading more of your adventures!
     Meanwhile, here in Bynum, Clyde is creating cats that are awesome, and they were showing this past weekend at the folk arts festival at Fearrington.  Not outside though, because believe it or not, we had snow!  (No accumulation though, but oh so pretty.)]]></description>
