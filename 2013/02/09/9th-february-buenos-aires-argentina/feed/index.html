		<description><![CDATA[Hi Jack and Amanda,

Sorry Rosie and I missed your &quot;bon voyage party&quot; but very happy to see you&#039;ve arrived safely and wish you all a great trip, with that wonderful weather, I bet you wish you&#039;d taken the Cambridge Special rather than the RP!
Good luck!]]></description>

		<description><![CDATA[What wonderful fun to see all the pictures and read about the events. When we first heard about the adventure of y&#039;all driving across the South American continent, it seemed rather scary, but seeing the pictures on your website and reading about your time thus far -- it all seems so much less scary now.  Actually, we could almost feel the sunlight on our skin as you sat and enjoyed gelato.  And the pictures of the lovely bits of archetecture -- so nice.  I especially like the paprika colored balcony trimmed in yellow!
   Sunday we talked with River (across the street here in Bynum NC) and he said that he had just spoken with a sleepy Diana.  We could tell in his voice how much he misses her!  Please keep sending pictures of all of you.  It&#039;s good to see you looking so relaxed and having such a good time!]]></description>
