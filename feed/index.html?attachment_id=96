		<description><![CDATA[Having been concerned about Stans sandals I now find myself worrying about Jacks shorts I know your dad was in the RAF during the war so I must presume that you are wearing his former issue shorts if I recall they are, part number 22c/456/big/mens for use of. May I suggest that if you couple up with Stans sandals you will be the talk of South American fashion!!  Glad to here that all is well I&#039;m back in blighty now playing with my toys.
